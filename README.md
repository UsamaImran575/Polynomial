6,5,0,12,2,0,3,2 // The first polynomial
This represents: 5x6+ 12x4+2x3+3x+2
5,5,0,12,0,0,3 // The Second polynomial degree,
This represents: 5x5+ 12x3+3


Program allow such operations
P1 = P0 + P1
P1 = P1 - P1
P1 = P1 - P1
Addition is: 5x6+5x5+ 12x4+14x3+3x+5
Subtraction is: 5x6-5x5+ 12x4-10x3+3x-1
